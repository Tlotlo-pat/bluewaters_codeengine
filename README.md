# Blue Waters
Blue Waters is a node red application that will help drive decision making in waste water management and clean water.
The major objectives of this application is to show or identify waste water plants in Botswana, and also around those
water plants identify rivers or dams with close proximity to the waste water plants to track the quality of water in those 
rivers.
This will help if the water treated does not have any untreated contaminants in the water, to help provide
better water treatments. Since temperatures affect how waste water is treated , the weather dashboard will help in providing 
insights on what may disrupt treatment of water.

The platform made use of IBM technologies, IBM cloud service Node Red.Also the application is deployed on IBM cloud,the following link direct you are to our application
